### Risk #12 - 10/18/2018
#### Introductions
* Rich & Steven

#### MKR is a governance token. What can I do with it?
* The goal: How can you manifest value from the token ownership?

#### Where should you hold your MKR tokens?
* In the voting structure or in a liquidity pool (store of value like Dai)
* In theory, there should be a deluge of proposals that will need to be voted on regularly.
* Continuous approval is part of executive vote
* Only want to keep your MKR in your wallet when you don’t have the liquidity preference for MKR -> Dai or if the voting structure doesn’t align with your security preference

#### Will retail users be less likely to lock up their position long term in comparison to a larger institutional investor?
* "Will a new proposal increase the supply of Dai?"
* Generally both should be incentivized to seek increased MKR value

#### Should we incentivize smaller holders to vote (and not incentivize larger holders)?
* This is based on the assumption that any proposal can pass
* All proposals will need to be thoroughly vetted to make sure it fits within the systems’ objectives

#### Is there a plan to encourage people to vote in general?
* This is the first system where you are able to take initiative into your own hands
* We can’t go blame the board of directors or management if something goes wrong

#### Would delegated voting be a way for smaller holders to seek representation?
* When considering an executive vote, we should be well past the tipping point of consideration as it has already passed a governance vote
* If there is still contention at the time of the executive vote, then we should let it go
* On the governance vote, it could be much more fluid

#### If a collateral is being used, what is the process for removing a collateral?
* The debt ceiling would be moved to 0
* Whatever is left in the system can only be unwound

#### How do we assemble a collateral portfolio?
* If we want to have similar risk per collateral then we need to identify what parameters we can hold constant
* At a full outstanding debt ceiling the expectation would be the portfolio is balanced
* The risk teams can incentivize CDP creation with specific collateral types through stability fee
* We don’t know which collateral type will hit its debt ceiling first —> leads to new question.. do we raise just that collateral ceiling?
    * Constantly need to reevaluate the portfolio makeup
    * If we only adjust the one ceiling it will overweight that collateral type in the portfolio
* Keep in mind, the debt ceiling is built on the liquidity profile of the collateral and considering the makeup of the whole portfolio

#### How do you incentivize the risk teams to stay working on MKR risk?
* Very difficultly
* Battleship metaphor —> see [Risk #10, What are the responsibilities of the Foundation vs MakerDAO?](https://github.com/scottrepreneur/maker-minutes/blob/master/risk_10.md)
* Some will be MKR holders, some will be incentivized by MKR holders but not holders themselves
* Will depend on what MKR holders desire out of the governance system
* Need lots of points of view to leverage “the wisdom of the crowd"

#### How do you reduce or mitigate the high correlations between collaterals in the system?
* When creating any portfolio we want to consider the std dev of the entire portfolio
* Marginal value at risk, provisional value at risk
* We have to either wait for orthogonal collateral types to become available or work with small debt ceilings to reduce the overall risk
