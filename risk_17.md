### [Risk #17 - 1/3/2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o)
#### Introductions
* Rich, Steven

#### Recap
* [What do Risk Teams look like? What should they do? #15](https://github.com/scottrepreneur/maker-minutes/blob/master/risk_15.md#405-risk-teams-what-does-a-good-risk-team-look-like) [& #16](https://github.com/scottrepreneur/maker-minutes/blob/master/risk_16.md#1344-what-sorts-of-information-templates-and-procedures-will-be-available-from-the-internal-risk-team-to-new-potential-risk-teams)
* Picking up from [supporting and submitting risk teams](https://github.com/scottrepreneur/maker-minutes/blob/master/risk_15.md#1551-how-is-the-weighting-system-applied-to-specific-risk-teams-or-proposals)

#### What do risk teams look like? What should they do? [[00:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=47) 
* There’s a spectrum of things risk teams can contribute to the governance process
* In the end both teams should submit

#### What is a supporting team? What do they do? [[1:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=97)
* Non-risk parameter, things like:
Bring in data, clean data, model validation service, quant or qual data, recourse audits, technical audits
* [Cont’d below](https://github.com/scottrepreneur/maker-minutes/blob/15d159fa5417adf1f4489fb8c40f3900ed4a410c/risk_17.md#what-is-a-supporting-team)

#### What does a recourse audit entail? (DGX token holder fly to SG to recover gold bars) [[2:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=164)
* If everything fails, how do we go back to the original issuer and make a claim against them?
* Gold bullion may not be the end recourse, would need local currency like Singaporean Dollars
* Liquidating bullion into fiat is well documented and regulated through brokers, not as simple
* Audit describes the path to recourse. A similar process can be used for NFTs, invoices, etc

#### What collateral-specific recourse are we auditing for? [[6:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=398)
* ERC20 compliant tokens
* Looking for operational risk in code (cont’d: [Risk Functions #3](https://github.com/scottrepreneur/maker-minutes/blob/15d159fa5417adf1f4489fb8c40f3900ed4a410c/risk_3.md#horizontal-and-vertical-elements-of-the-risk-function) and [Collateral considerations #9](https://github.com/scottrepreneur/maker-minutes/blob/15d159fa5417adf1f4489fb8c40f3900ed4a410c/risk_9.md#what-is-the-primary-consideration-when-were-considering-an-asset-type-for-the-portfolio) )

#### What is a supporting team? [[7:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=421)
* Supporting teams have to cover a wide spectrum of risk verticals
* We need to consider:
    * How do we vet these teams?
    * How do they contribute?
    * How does their contribution get compensated?
* Supporting teams may participate in the submission process by submitting their work that is being passed to the other risk teams
* Ex. A risk team cleans data and provides it to the system.
    * Should we require the data be open sourced?
    * Do we allow them to keep the data and share with the risk teams that need the data?

#### Where do risk teams come from? [[9:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=567)
* We’re adopting traditional tools and applying it to the space with appropriate tweaks
* The decentralized nature of the function being the largest tweak

#### Are there agencies that can be contracted to do this work? [[11:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=685)
* Absolutely. Big 4 auditors have departments to independent companies and investment banks, etc
* The detailed processor everything have been documented
* The blockchain gives us an advantage on the transparency side

#### What do we do with respect to the data these teams create? How do we compensate them appropriately? [[13:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=816)
* When a team takes on the process of cleaning data and making it available the MKR holders, through the governance process, need to vet the process
    * Where are you getting the data?
    * How are you cleaning it?
    * How are you providing it?
* Is the data kept within the risk team or made available outside?
* With respect to both qualitative and quantitative data
* Do qualitative teams submit to the more quantitative teams wrt final submission

#### What mechanisms are in place to support these processes? [[18:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=1087)
* We’re diving into the inner workings of the risk process so that the community might find opportunities to grow the ecosystem through new businesses
* The internal risk team will be the model for the path to becoming a risk team, being vetted by the community, being accepted into the system, and submitting parameter proposals for voting

#### In addition to collateral models, we’ll need two other types of models [[21:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=1276)
* Portfolio models - looking at the makeup of the portfolio as a whole
* Economic models - updating parameters like the stability fee

#### Risk function will come front and center, more than the previous year  [[24:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=1467)
* More questions will arise like:
	* "How do I become a risk team?"
	* “How does one submit risk parameters?"
	* “What does the data look like?"
* Potentially answering those questions as well.
* The internal team is running parallel to reaching out to the community, to get involved in the risk process, will be releasing a Liquidity-adjusted Value At Risk assessment
* Rather than providing a list of the process steps and inevitably attempt to discover all the nuances, working with the community through the process the nuances can be discovered organically

####  What are some of the things risk teams are looking at if they’re taking a holistic view when a new collateral type is proposed? [[33:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=2009)
* In the traditional finance world there are expected risk, expected returns, correlation matrices
* The liquidity adjustment comes into play wrt allocating large positions slowly to prevent slippage
* We have the [three debt ceilings](https://github.com/scottrepreneur/maker-minutes/blob/15d159fa5417adf1f4489fb8c40f3900ed4a410c/risk_7.md#what-do-we-know-about-the-debt-ceiling)
* Consider the collateral’s business, economic function and the remedy to any dislocation of supply and demand

#### [Digix for example](https://github.com/scottrepreneur/maker-minutes/blob/15d159fa5417adf1f4489fb8c40f3900ed4a410c/risk_2.md#dgx-and-eth-have-few-similar-market-risks-we-could-recommend-a-lower-collateralization-ratio-paired-with-lower-debt-ceiling-because-they-have-lower-small-band-movement-but-operational-risk-would-be-near-catastrophic) [[36:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=2201)
* Bringing in Digix even though the market cap is only 3 million may catalyze the demand for DGX

#### Does that potential inflation of market cap pose as a risk to the system? [[38:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=2315)
* We’re driven through two primary functions: the ability to pledge collateral and the ability to draw value
* Want to avoid being the primary factor of inflation
* The Maker system will drive significant value to Ethereum and other networks, given interoperability

#### Could this contribute to a catastrophe if the value is derived from being a collateral? [[41:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=2467)
* If mismanaged, absolutely
* Banks will lend to small cap companies at a 10:1 buffer to be safe
* The bank will look into recourse. Determine the value of the assets or take the stock and find a buyer of last resort

#### So, when a collateral is added the liquidity risk will be factored in up front? [[43:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=2587)
* Yes, the analysis will need to be ongoing to ensure continual compliance
* That is our competitive edge

#### In the traditional market when you’re trading futures there is a basis risk that describes the difference between the future price and the underlying asset price [[45:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=4712)
* There is similar application to tokens. What is the basis risk between the token and the underlying company?
* Security token: either a token to represent a company share or a token to represent another security
* Hopefully these ERC assets retain the correlation and volatility of their underlying value rather than succumbing to the crypto volatility

#### Would we accept short tokens like those from DY/DX as collateral? [[48:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obambVe3t3o&t=2898)
* The acceptance of a collateral boils down to the ability to recourse all the way back to the liquidation preference
* The primary piece of recourse we have right now is price discovery in the open market
