### [Risk #1 - 7/12/2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W-Unj4LlzU)
##### Introductions
* Rich, Jess, Steven

##### What is Risk Management? 
* Understand the layers of risk of coordinating a system.
* What are the layers of Risk?
    * Economic layer - creating dai mechanisms
    * Financial Risk - collateral volatilities
    * Operational Risk - business risk

We’ll process the scientific governance basics, then produce models.

##### What are the benefits of decentralized risk management?
* Technocratic concept - proxy votes through an experienced group of delegates
* Competition & Collaboration - teams of risk model prescribers and analyzers
    * Microservices can be created to handle individual steps in the process
    * What data sources can we use? (below)
* Ultimately, MKR holders vote to select some or all models

##### What data sources will we use in the models?
* Qualitative
    * White papers, pitch decks
* Quantitative
    * Volume data
    * Daily Transaction and other public metrics

##### How will we attract risk teams? How could the community validate these teams?
* We’re actively sourcing that criteria through these meetings.
* We’ll generally create a criteria and vote on a criteria to apply to our selection process
* We can gauge the potential teams preference to the medium/long term
    * i.e. an individual is ok but an established entity is better and describes their intent a bit more

##### Why would a risk team want to participate?
* Assuming institutional interest there would be incentive to create teams to correctly allocate the risk
* Every MKR holder is activist investor and a director on the board. Participating includes forming risk teams to correctly allocate your risk.
* Check and balance. Since MKR holders are buyer of last resort, there is very much at stake to handling this aspect of governance.
* A caveat: Private institutional investors might be incentivized to keep their findings private. We’ll need teams to publicize their work for MKR holders to be educated
* Two types of teams:
    * Explicit teams: contribute and very transparent
    * Implicit teams: contribute but might not share where findings came from
    * MKR holders will need to determine weights assigned to each

##### What will Risk Team 0 look like?
* Model frameworks
* Team structure

##### How do we find consensus between risk averse and risk accepting teams?
* The team provides a risk construct with reproducibility. We need to factor this into our 
* There will be bias included in each construct. We’ll find the average.

##### Will there be cartels?
* It’s our nature to create groups around values. Potentially shows maturity in the system.

##### Will the risk teams public?
* Up to the team
* Not necessarily are they public?
Is their construct transparent? Obvious? Applicable? Are they committed?
* Teams may use their reputations as leverage
Goldman Sachs creates a risk construct… are they here to help us or here to destroy us?

##### Will teams use their reputations?
* Pseudonymity could work for early teams. It’s tough to prescribe

##### Will Risk Team 0 (The Foundation’s Risk Team) be insulated from outside influence?
* No, collaborative. Open to other views that can be proven with data.

##### Closing Thoughts
The scientific method is always best guess. Its not an absolute truth. We’re always looking to disprove previous notions and hypothesis. Continuous iteration.

Large actors will use very strategic moves that don’t always align with public portrayals.

On-chain collateralized assets can be a significant piece of this new chain economy as it becomes an integrated aspect into the ‘regular’ economy. Would most likely create a hybrid economic model where blockchain is supporting the economic value being created already.
