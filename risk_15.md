### [Risk #15 - 12/6/2018](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E)
##### Introductions
* Rich, Steven

##### Recap [[0:58]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=58)
* Quorum requires constant vigilance
* Apathy and the need to inform MKR holders
* Discussed vote purchasing and vote implication
* Gov vote and Exec vote names are a bit confusing. Suggesting governance poll.
* Executive vote comes from execution or implementation of code rather than the conventional management executive

##### Risk Teams. What does a good risk team look like? [[4:05]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=245)
* Longevity: Need to have a long time horizon
* Transparency: differing levels of transparency will affect believability
* Contribute their assessment of collateral for the system

##### Who can be a risk team? Who should be a risk team? [[8:12]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=492)
* Anyone, theoretically. Need to be a stakeholder at least, to provide proposals
* The transparency and longevity are extensions of being a viable to sustain the participation in the system

##### Is there an issue of independence? Large CDP holders could be biased to their positions. [[9:51]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=591)
* All the biases are different points of view. We’re seeking as many points of view as possible.
* Very few points of view will be without bias. The aggregate of the points of view will hopefully give a meshed view
* Reproducible research is the most important factor for scientific governance

##### Longevity: Does a risk team have to be around for a while to participate or does the waiting increase over time? [[13:34]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=814)
* The weighting increases
* Reputation value increases

#####Transparency: More transparent risk teams will raise their weighting as well? [[14:52]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=892)
* The process must be transparent
* Ideally a tool will provide the code, the data. Let you play with it and try to break it

##### How is the weighting system applied to specific risk teams or proposals? [[15:51]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=951)
* The ecosystem will have supporting entities and submitting entities
* Teams may perform functions besides submitting proposals, will also need approvals
* We’ll need to bootstrap the how the weightings are attributed

##### Are the risk teams going to be independent from the Foundation? [[19:05]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=1145)
* Ideally, they are completely independent
* Risk team 0 is meant to be a template for future teams

##### Are constructs available to the community?
* Nearly. Determining the best presentation format

##### How do we incentivize the risk teams? [[23:05]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=1385)
* In the stability fee is a component that contributes to operating costs and compensating service providers

##### The ecosystem will grow around Maker through the stakeholders. Distributed risk teams is one component of the overall ecosystem [[27:39]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=1659)

##### How do we apply the contributions of the risk teams to the system? [[29:15]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=1755)
* How do we include collateral and build the portfolio
    * Get risk teams in place and incentivize them (pay them)
    * Weighted payments based on contributions to the system

##### How do we go about paying them? What would terms potentially look like? [[33:23]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2003)
* Quantity of proposals and longevity of support would need to be considered
* Accuracy (quality) would additionally be factored into the weighting

##### Are we contemplating a skin-in-the-game model? [[35:35]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2135)
* You must be a member of the community to put forward a proposal
* Additionally skin-in-the-game is a plausible construct. Reputation is the biggest thing at stake initially
* By the nature of flywheeling the process, we’ve elected not to prescribe any initial rules

##### Are we imagining risk teams as non profit organizations? [[39:07]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2347)
* Not likely, service provision is usually not done on an not-for-profit basis

##### When do you see risk teams outside of the foundation to be implemented? [[39:51]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2391)
* Launch MCD, get collateral approved through Risk Team 0, step through the process with dialogs
* Shortly after an initial example or two there could be two to three entities participating within a few months

##### So there needs to be a clear Standard Operating Procedure for the risk governance? [[41:23]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2483)
* Following a framework to governance and understanding the framing around a worthy collateral-type and getting the dialog around it so the community can de-risk it and get it through a governance poll and eventually to an executive vote

##### What are the components of the stability fee? [[43: 01]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2581)
* Credit Risk, Operating Cost, Inflation component

##### How will the risk constructs from the independent teams be combined/weighted? [[44:28]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2668)
* Weighting is gathered through initial incentivized and reputation model
* A risk team could be come corrupted, so risk teams could be incentivized to check other risk teams

##### Are there checks and balances in this function? [[46:10]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2770)
* Would inevitably centralize compliance

##### How will the debate occur through the voting process? [[46:54]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2814)
* The framework will help to standardize the tools so they can be consistently and effectively vetted

##### How will data be sourced to use in the risk assessment? [[48:53]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=2933)
* Collect data directly 
* CoinMarketCap isn’t ideal, but it’s accessible

##### How can we prevent bad data? [[50:22]](https://youtu.be/DgozX9W4A1E?t=3022)
* We’ll negotiate acceptable data sets and standardizing data usage
