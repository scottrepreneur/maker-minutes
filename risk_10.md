### [Risk #10 - Special Edition: a16z Investment - 9/27/2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjEmY1UG7jk)
#### Introductions
* Rich, Steven

#### What does the sale do for MakerDAO and for a16z Crypto?
* Creating a new blockchain economy for the first time, where we’re running up against many incompatible local jurisdictional legislation
* Regulators have a primary incentive to protect consumers, and they are trying to understand how to correctly distinguish risks from new types of opportunities
* a16z has specific knowledge on the incoming process navigating the regulatory framework
* Bridge between the current technology environment to bring cooperation between their goals and ours
* Regulation will be an ongoing process to show transparency and compliance, not a one-time rubberstamp

#### What types of relationships will the DAO have with a16z?
* True sense of partnership:
    * Sounding board
    * Loudest cheerleader
    * Butting heads potentially, to identify the root problems and determine the best solutions 
* Uncover as much uncertainty possible
* How do we interact with their other portfolio companies? 
	* Any value added opportunity will be mutually beneficial
* Their firm has a huge network where we can find many resources

#### What kind of signal does their interest show to the space and the broader technology community?
* Gives legitimacy to blockchain and crypto with their Crypto division and it's investment in Maker
* Making the realization of Maker's involvement facilitating this new economy more tangible to the outside

#### What specific legal challenges are we facing for MakerDAO or the Foundation?
* Its more a conundrum of unknowns that we’re trying to uncover rather than a specific challenge we’re attempting to navigate
* Lots of speculation about both directions of the (token-categorization) debate, but the ambiguity remains
* Need to find clarity as soon as possible or the blockchain economy will continue stalling
* That clarity can gives others in the space context about one workable way to effectively establish operations

#### What are the responsibilities of the Foundation vs MakerDAO?
* MakerDAO hasn’t been deployed as a fully-capable battleship yet. It’s still currently being built in harbor.
* Token holders are sailors on the ship, as the foundation continues building
* The roles involved in how to run the ship are different from the processes involved in building it
* Keeping the ship running will be up to the MKR holders once empowered
* It’s not a clean switch, needs iterative testing
* Once up and running all decisions will need to be made through decentralized governance, including who will deliver the services, how they will be delivered and when

#### A substantial amount of collateral will be locked in CDPs in the long run. Maker will have due influence over Ethereum governance as a whole and it could be construed that a16z is purchasing a seat at the table with EF/Ethereum through this. [Tweet Referenced](https://twitter.com/FollowTheChain/status/1044879074290733058) Can you share a take on this? 
* Scientific governance relies on diligent governance of the system
* It must focus on it’s singular purpose to benefit the organization
* Conversations are ongoing about the results of contentious forks and how dapps will select the majority fork

#### Would it be beneficial for Maker to fund another core developer group? Having separate clients?
* Ultimately competition would be driven through incentives to create the best implementation
* Moving to a new (slightly better) version would be trivial with a motivated community
* The comparison is a bit difficult since contracts are deployed once and can’t easily be actively updated 

#### Has a16z shared any plans about how active they will be with the governance process?
* Extraordinarily active. Will be leading the charge on uncovering the best tactics.
* Joining the crowd as some of the most passionate about the project

#### Was the impact on the valuation of price considered when negotiating the details of the deal?
* Money is not the only value being delivered by a16z in this deal
* Their full partnership will pay visible dividends
* The results will be clear as the ecosystem continues to develop
* Two way street: We can teach them about the rest of the ecosystem and open them up to significant opportunities as well
